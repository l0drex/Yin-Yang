# Changing the theme in your application

If you want to write code that changes the theme of an application,
you have two possible ways to do so:

1. Develop a [plugin](#Plugins) for running commands or changing values in config files.
2. [Communicate](#Communication) from an external application.


## Plugins

Plugins provide a way to directly change the theme by running commands or
changing a value in a config file.

Each plugin is a class in `yin_yang/plugins` and extends `plugin.py`.
Write your code to set any theme by overwriting the `set_theme()` function.


### Default themes

If you want to provide default values for light and dark themes,
you can set the class attributes `theme_light` and `theme_dark`.


### Configuration

Every plugin has its own section in the application's config file.
It consists of the following options:
- `enabled`: If the plugin is enabled or not
- `light_theme`: The theme that should be used in light mode
- `dark_theme`: The theme that should be used in dark mode

If you need to store more information, you should have a look at `yin_yang/config.py`.


### GUI

By default, each plugin has its own section in the tab plugins,
with one simple text input to set the desired theme.

If you want to provide a combobox instead, you can simply implement the `get_available_themes()` function.
Please don't forget to add exception handling for cases where the application is not installed.
For example, you could do the following:
```python
def get_available_themes(self) -> dict[str, str]:
    try:
        # your implementation
        ...
        return themes_dict
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return {}
```


### Testing

Testing plugins currently only checks that none of the enabled plugins `set_theme` functions
result in an error.
To test your plugin you have to:
1. Enable it (via UI or the config file stored in `~/.config/yin-yang/yin-yang.json`).
2. Run `tests/test_plugins.py`.


## Communication

If you need to update the theme from an external application, you can do the following:

1. Write a plugin as described in _Plugins_ without implementing the `set_theme` function.
   This will create a section for your application in the config file.
1. Call `communicate.py` as a process from your application.
2. Write your application name into stdin of that process.
3. Read the response from stdout. It should be a json object with the following data:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "dark_mode": true,
  "scheduled": true,
  "themes": ["light_theme", "dark_theme"],
  "times": [1615881600, 1615924800]
} 
```

- `enabled` is true if your plugin is enabled.
  If not, the response only contains `enabled` and `dark_mode`
- `dark_mode` is true if the system is currently using a dark theme
- `scheduled` is true if the theme changes automatically.
  If not, the response does not contain the times section.
- `themes` is a list of the preferred themes a strings.
- `times` is a list of the times when the theme changes.
  These are unix times in seconds since the epoch and always "surround" the current time.
  This enables your external application to calculate the preferred theme directly and
  compare it to `dark_mode` if you want.
  > For example, the times provided above would be the times when called on `2021-03-16 13:31:05`.


# Default themes

We are searching for the default themes in the following plugins:
- Gnome
- Gnome GTK

If you now the names for the default themes in any of these applications,
please create an issue, or a pull request where you add those theme names into the
corresponding plugin class as following:

_Example: /yin_yang/plugins/gnome.py_

```python
class Gnome(Plugin):
    theme_dark = 'name of the default dark theme as written in config files'
    theme_bright = 'name of the default bright theme'
```

As the plugin konsole was developed on a Manjaro system and Manjaro provides additional
themes, it might be that the default light theme of Konsole is not available on all systems.
If so, please create an issue for that.

Another plugin we need some help with is the wallpaper plugin. It would be nice to provide
some default wallpapers. If you want to add some, feel free to create a pull request.


# Translations

If you want to help to translate the GUI into another language, follow these steps:

1. If not done already, create a fork of this repository and clone it.
2. Add `TRANSLATIONS += resources/yin-yang.[lang].ts`, with [lang] being your language code.
3. Run `scripts/build_ui.sh` from the top level directory (where `main.py` is located).
4. Fix the script changes:
    - Go to `/yin_yang/ui`
    - In `main_window.py`, change the last line back to `import yin_yang.ui.resources_rc`
    - In `resource_rc.py`, change the first __code__ line back to `from PyQt5 import QtCore`
5. After running the script, there should be a file called `yin_yang.[lang].ts`.
   Open it with _Qt Linguist_.
6. Translate all the text.
7. When you are ready, click <kbd>File</kbd> â†’ <kbd>Share</kbd>. This will create a `.qm`file.
8. Run steps 2 and 3 again to make the changes visible in the application.
9. Create a pull request to make the translation usable by everybody.

In future releases, steps 4 and 7 might become unnecessary as they could be implemented
in the `build_ui.sh` script. If you now how to do this, feel free to make a pull request.
